The content of this pane should NOT be edited. Any edits will be
lost.

You are using the experimental 3-pane diff editor config. Some of
the following instructions may have been written with a 2-pane
diff editing in mind and be a little inaccurate.

You are editing changes in: kqkrsq a2d41c2 (no description set)

The diff initially shows the commit's changes relative to:
twqtos 052d4b6 tauri@origin| Nightly rustfmt

Adjust the right side until it shows the contents you want. If you
don't make any changes, then the operation will be aborted.
